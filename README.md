# push_swap
課題のPush_swapについてまとめる。
目標はとりあえず課題を理解すること。

## 1. subject
- You must write a program called push_swap that will receive as argument the stack a in the format of a list of intgers. The first argument must be the one on top of the stack(be careful with the order).
- The program must display the list of instructions(shortest)
to sort the stack a, from smallest to largest where the smallest is at the top of the stack.
- The instrctions should be separated using a "\n" and nothing else.
- The goal is to sort the stack with as few operation as possible. During the evaluation we will compare the number of instructions obtained by your program with a maximum instruction range.
- Your program will receive no points either if your program displays a list that is too long or if the result is not correct.
- If no parameters are specified, the program should not display anything and should return control to the user.
- In case of an error, you should display Error followed by a "\n" in the standard error output. Some of the possible errors are: arguments that are not integers, arguments greater than an int, and/or finding duplicate numbers.
