## 1. Subject
### 1.1. The rules
- The game consists of two stacks, called a and b.
- To start with:
    - In a you will have positive and/or negative numbers, never duplicated.
    - There will be nothing in b.
- The purpose of this game is that order stack a's numbers in ascending order.
- The following operations are available:
    - sa :**swap a** Swaps the first two elements on top of stack **a**. It does nothing if there are one or fewer elements.
    - sb :**swap b** Swaps the first two elements on top of stack **b**. It does nothing if there are one or fewer elements.
    - ss :**Swap both** at the same time.
    - pa :**push a** Takes the first element of stack **b** and puts it on top of stack **a**. It does nothing if **b** is empty.
    - pb :**push b** Takes the first element of stack **a** and puts it on top of stack **b**. It does nothing if **a** is empty.
    - ra :**rotate a** Moves all the elements of the stack **a** up one position, so that the first element becomes the last.
    - rb :**rotate b** Moves all the elements of the stack **b** up one position, so that the first element becomes the last.
    - rr :**rotate both** Moves all the elements of stack **a** and stack **b** up one position at the same time, so that the first element becomes the last one.
    - rra :**reverse rotate a** Shifts all the elements of the stack **a** down one position, so that the last element becomes the first.
    - rrb :**reverse rotate b** Shifts all the elements of the stack **b** down one position, so that the last element becomes the first.
    - rrr :**reverse rotate both** Moves all the elements of stack **a** and **b** down one position at the same time, so that the last element becomes the first.

### 1.2. 
### 1.3. The programme
- You must write a program called push_swap that will receive as argument the stack a in the format of a list of integers. The first argument must be the one on top of the stack(be careful with the order).
- The program must display the list of instructions(shortest)
to sort the stack a, from smallest to largest where the smallest is at the top of the stack.
- The instructions should be separated using a "\n" and nothing else.
- The goal is to sort the stack with as few operation as possible. During the evaluation we will compare the number of instructions obtained by your program with a maximum instruction range.
- Your program will receive no points either if your program displays a list that is too long or if the result is not correct.
- If no parameters are specified, the program should not display anything and should return control to the user.
- In case of an error, you should display Error followed by a "\n" in the standard error output. Some of the possible errors are: arguments that are not integers, arguments greater than an int, and/or finding duplicate numbers.

## 2. Cryptic subject
### 2.1. How many arguments are required.
- At least 500.
### 2.2. How many times I can sort?
It depends on the number of arguments.
- If it's sorted, it should be 0 times.
- If there are 3 arguments, less than 4 times.
- If there are 5 arguments, less than 13 times(in the subject, it's put 6 arguments, but according to Slack we have to show the instruction shorter than 12 times with 5 arguments, also guidelines.pdf(it's a copy of correction in Urduliz)).
- 100 arguments, 700 times (until 1500 times it's acceptable, but points will be deducted)
- 500 arguments, 5500 times (until 11500 times it's acceptable, but points will be deducted)
### 2.3. Is there any time limit?
- No, but it should be reasonable time.

## 3. Possible error
- No arguments (argc should be more than 2) -> Should will be written "\n"
- It's not integer
- There are dubbed numbers
- 
## 4. Algorithm
**::(> <)::**  
It's recommended to make my own algorithm for a week...   
<!-- If the arguments are less than 7, use Brute-force search, and then for arguments more than 6 use quick sort? -->
### 4.1. Quick sort
- Quick sorting is a method of repeatedly sorting into groups of 'values less than the standard' and groups of 'values greater than the standard' by setting an appropriate standard value. First of all, I have to decide the standard(pibot)  
### 4.2. Insert sort
- Insertion sort is an alignment algorithm that takes values one by one from an "unaligned array" and inserts them in the appropriate positions in an "aligned array"
### 4.3. Merge sort
- Merge sorting is an alignment algorithm that repeatedly divides into two parts until the number of elements is one, and then returns in an aligned manner.
### 4.4. Brute-force search
- Explore all possible street numbers.
### 4.5. Binary seach
### 4.6. Ternary seach
### 4.7. Backtracking method (Depth-first search)
- Depth-first search is an algorithm for exploning graphs and tree structures, in which the path does not return until it comes across a dead-end node where no further progress can be made, and then proceeds through neighbouring nodes.  


### memo

    -1. if the number of turn is same as the turn is recorded -> goodbye  
    (Because there is no possibility to be shorter than that)
        -2. if STACK a is sorted, update the record and exit
            -3. start check all commands
            while check all of them...
                -4. if there is command redundant, quit and go back to 3
                    -5. change the STACK
                        -6. reenter to 1
                            (-?. depth first check?)
So, I can check all of commands one by one, but also cut some cases in line 1 and 4

Theoretically, it is able to count until 8 turns
(with simple calculation, normally takes 1s for 10000 * 10000 times, as I have 11 commands, 11^8 = 214358881 so it will take 2s more or less.)   
*review required*  
If I will check all case one by one, I may be able to omit 1.? (If so, I only need once to record the first turn)  
This will be simpler than memo, maybe do it simply first, and then if there is problem, change?  
*review required*
