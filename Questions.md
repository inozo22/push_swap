# Questions
I will leave here questions and a tedious soliloquy.  

## Questions about subject
- should I accept more than 1 arguments? Like ./push_swap "1" "2" "3" "4" "5"  Or only I must accept ./push_swap 1 2 3 4 5, and how about spaces and tab
 - solved(2023/02/08): I have to accept ./push_swap "1 2 3 4 5" and ./push_swap 1 2 3 4 5, so it could be both 1 argument or more. (according to document ggl drive)
- What do I have to show in the evaluation? Only instructions are enough? or also I need to show the sorting? -> only instruction (by Iker)

## Questions about programming

- Tengo que aprender la estructura de la lista bien, (sobre todo voy a usar *doubly-circularly-linked list*)
- Y algoritmo. 
- If I need to show the function with 3, 5, 100, 500 numbers, better to separate function less than 6 and more? 
- There are people do this project using array in stead of list..., curiously, the 42 Urduliz document recommends not to use list orz.
- I don't know why there is function read, thus I will not open any file descriptor?
