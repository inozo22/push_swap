# Questions
I will leave here questions and a tedious soliloquy.  

## Questions about subject
- should I accept more than 1 arguments? Like ./push_swap "1" "2" "3" "4" "5"  Or only I must accept ./push_swap 1 2 3 4 5, and how about spaces and tab
- What do I have to show in the evaluation? Only instructions are enough? or also I need to show the sorting? 

## Questions about programming

- Tengo que aprender la estructura de la lista bien, (sobre todo voy a usar *doubly-circularly-linked list*)
- Y algoritmo. 
- If I need to show the function with 3, 5, 100, 500 numbers, better to separate function less than 6 and more?
